      'hi there,,  ,  i will do my best here to offer you a snapshot, or perhaps even a,  zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there,  is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like,  when two people are close enough to actually sense each,  other.,  i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much,  more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here,  goes.,  ,  my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and,  adventurous. im all about my next adventure and i have a big,  appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and,  spontaneity in my day to day.,  im fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. ive,  cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and,  not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. theres,  often quite a gap between story and reality. as byron katie,  likes to say: "reality is always kinder than the story we tell,  ourselves about it.",  ,  i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left,  inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my,  bills on time and dont make too many messes in life. (well maybe,  some intentional ones, like when im finger painting with chocolate,  pudding),  if i like something, more is good, if not, theres plenty else to,  try.,  i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means,  dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my,  emotions, i wouldnt trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big,  pleasure, i also like a day in my pjs every now and then.,  ,  i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine,,  its such a rich and unique alchemy. what im drawn to in a a man,  is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone whos,  comfortable enough in himself that he doesnt need to pretend,,  posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure,  enough that when hes feeling something he can share it honestly.,  at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if,  youre familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.,  ,  my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic,,  engaged, and a lot of fun. im drawn to connecting with those who,  are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to,  live, act, and make decisions from today.,  we all have shadow, and one of its favorite places to show itself,  is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that,,  and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty,  quickly.,  ,  i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what im,  getting, than how im contributing, and i strive to have a positive,  impact whenever i can.,  im definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also,  need some down time to hang with myself.,  ,  although i love children, im probably not looking to have any, but,  i sure like playing with them. i wouldnt rule out relationship,  with you if youre a dad, so long as youve also got time and space,  for another significant relationship in your life.',

      'my name is chris lee and it is my personal mission to bring awesome,  things into this world.,  ,  i just said that with a straight face.,  ,  i am a cross-culture geek-otaku, a connoisseur of oddities and a,  product of prolonged exposure to fiction. i am an artist and a,  gamer, and i hold deep passions for both. more than anything, i am,  a creator; i enjoy constructing ideas and giving them life through,  art, writing, or <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=roleplay">roleplay</a>. as such, it is my personal,  mission to bring awesome things into this world, and because of,  that i am driven by a craving for success.,  ,  despite that, i am not a particularly deep person (at least, i,  dont like to think that i am). one might call me eccentric or,  whimsical. i enjoy cheap thrills as much as i enjoy grand epics. i,  make big deals out of little issues and take little issue with big,  deals. i can get enthusiastic and possibly wax poetic about the,  most inane, trivial things. its also worth noting that i am,  notoriously perverted, a trait not-at-all hidden by my choice of,  artwork. dont worry, i can distinguish fiction from reality,,  otherwise i wouldnt be here.,  ,  **disclaimer**,  the personality matrix will tell you that i am "more experienced in,  love". do not believe it. my confession is as follows:,  ,  i have not "dated" before, in a manner of speaking. i had a,  girlfriend once seven years ago, and nothing else since. i am,  pained but not shamed to admit that i am romantically starved. more,  than anything, i want someone to share my mind and heart with. i,  <em>almost</em> said that with a straight face.',

    essay:
      'and when you appear,,  all the rivers flow in my body,,  bells shake the sky,,  and a hymn fills the earth.,  ,  that verse, the last stanza of the queen, by pablo neruda, pretty,  much defines why im here and what im looking for. having once,  known that kind of love, and having blown it, i know how rare it,  is. but if it happens, i wont blow it a second time. im not here,  for one of those plain vanilla, low-conflict, low-passion affairs.,  my membership in okc is but one component of my search for someone,  who will knock my sox off, blow me away and shake me to my,  foundation. thats a tall order. but, as i wrote, my okc search is,  but one component. and i will not settle. most of all, i would be,  delighted to find someone with a very pronounced right brain.,  thats my bias.,  ,  "its beautiful to take a chance,  and if you fall, you fall.,  and im thinkin,  i wouldnt mind at all.,  and that would be, but beautiful",  ,  that short verse, from"but beautiful," a jazz classic that has been,  covered by every vocalist who matters, pretty much summarizes where,  im at in my life and in my quest. i have learned to open my heart,,  no matter what, and be prepared to lose it all in order to win it,  all.,  ,  by the way, some of you might remember my first incarnation on,  okcupid as roiphe. that profile was roiphe 1.0; this profile is,  roiphe 2.0, under the name of bobwhite1081. okc took roiphe 1.0,  down because i flaunted the rules by using alias photos instead of,  my own pics. i used james dean, jon hamm, cary grant, humphrey,  bogart, peter sellers (as dr. strangelove), and alsace man with,  corkscrew, a ralph steadman painting, among others. more than a few,  busybodies (some of whom had no pictures at all on their own,  profiles) ratted me out to okc. it happened one too many times and,  okc took down my roiphe profile. so this time, the pic you see on,  this profile is a self-portrait, of yours truly, shot by yours,  truly.,  ,  im someone who lives fully in the senses. whatever i do, i do with,  passion. otherwise, why bother? this isnt a dress rehearsal; its,  the real deal and our one and only shot. thats why im a foodie;,  its why im into wine; its why i drive a ragtop. whats better,  than the wind in your hair and the sun on your face? well, actually,  there are a few things better but thats a conversation we can have,  when we meet. im into jazz in a big, big way and attend quite a,  few concerts presented by sfjazz, the countrys best jazz festival,,  if not the worlds. i also have a rather large and growing,  collection of jazz cds. i just bought "the shearing piano," a,  george shearing cd with a version of "stella by starlight" that,  will give you goosebumps. i also just acquired "bennett sings,  ellington" by tony bennett. it has a version of "prelude to a,  kiss," a song ( and arrangement) that displays vocal mastery that,  only artists one can count on one hand possess. i listen to jazz,  constantly, at home and in my car. id do it at the office but,  streaming music or video takes up too much of the companys network,  bandwidth and i get nasty messages from it if i do it. maybe ill,  start taking cds to work with me. i dread the possibility that mp3,  will become the standard format for music and am actively buying,  cds while i still can, before they too become museum pieces,  alongside vinyl.,  ,  i love to kiss, and if i do say so myself, im awfully good at it,,  as ive been told more than once. i love to stretch out on the sofa,  with a mature (60-68), sexy woman and kiss for long stretches of,  time. i love to kiss until i ache. i love the ache. by the way, im,  not looking for a younger woman. but i want to sincerely thank the,  guys my age who are looking for a younger woman. they leave the,  real women for me. as my father used to say, theres no fool like,  an old fool.,  ,  i have lots of cool kitchen toys and know how to use them all. but,  i also love to try new restaurants and new things to eat that i,  havent tried before. if one of them really knocks me out, i try to,  replicate it. for not having been professionally trained, im one,  of the better, non-professional chefs around. but i make an unholy,  mess in the kitchen when im cooking. as you probably know, there,  is a strong movement in the culinary world to use fresh, locally,  grown foods in the kitchen. this is a beautiful thing. but its not,  the only thing. without proper technique, all you get is a bad meal,  made from good stuff. technique is everything. by the way, i hold,  the secret to making perfect french fries. perfect is not an easy,  trick, but i know how to achieve it, for french fries anyway.,  ,  but the kitchen isnt the only room in which i have skills. im,  handy in every room in the house. modest too, you might have,  noticed by now.,  ,  besides being able to cook, i know my way to the dry cleaners. i,  know how to operate the vacuum and the washer and dryer. my,  interest in finding a match has nothing to do with those,  things.,  ,  politically, im a yellow dog, which means that im about as,  liberal as you can get. but i am no longer a democrat. im too,  liberal for them. heres a quote from mark twain that seems,  appropriate for the present times: in the beginning of a change,,  the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. when,  his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing,  to be a patriot. clearly, the real patriot is scarce; so scarce as,  to be almost nowhere to be found, despite the assertions of so many,  who lay claim to the title. but they are hijackers, claiming their,  definition is the only true definition.,  ,  here are some other quotes i like:,  if youre going to walk on thin ice, you may as well dance ,  anon,  "you were once wild here. dont let them tame you!" - isadora,  duncan,  "dance, when youre broken open. dance, if youve torn the bandage,  off. dance in the middle of the fighting. dance in your blood.,  dance when youre perfectly free." - mawlana jalal-al-din,  rumi,  dont ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes,  you come alive. and then go and do that. - howard thurman,  you can have anything you want if you want it desperately enough.,  you must want it with an exuberance that erupts through the skin,  and joins the energy that created the world. -sheila graham,  passion is universal humanity. without it religion, history,,  romance and art would be useless. - honor de balzac,  our passions are the true phoenixes; when the old one is burnt,  out, a new one rises from its ashes. - johann wolfgang von,  goethe,  "love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks,  simultaneously the head, the heart and the senses." - lao tzu,  "an inordinate passion for pleasure is the secret of remaining,  young" - oscar wilde,  a man who is able to control his passions is a man whose passions,  are weak enough to be controlled. - william blake,  "of all the worldly passions, lust is the most intense. all other,  worldly passions seem to follow in its train." - buddha,  be still if you have nothing to say; when true passion moves you,,  say what youve got to say and say it hot. - d.h. lawrence,  there is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a,  life that is less than the one you are capable of living. - nelson,  mandela,  we must act out passion before we can feel it. - jean-paul,  sartre,  nothing great in the world has ever been accomplished without,  passion. - georg wilhelm friedrich hegel,  better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of,  some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. - james,  joyce,  man is only great when he acts from passion. - benjamin,  disraeli,  honest criticism means nothing: what one wants is unrestrained,  passion, fire for fire. - henry miller,  death is the only pure, beautiful conclusion of a great passion.,  - d. h. lawrence,  when a man and a woman have an overwhelming passion for each,  other, it seems to me, in spite of such obstacles dividing them as,  parents or husband, that they belong to each other in the name of,  nature, and are lovers by divine right, in spite of human,  convention or the laws. - nicolas de chamfort,  it is the souls duty to be loyal to its own desires. it must,  abandon itself to its master passion. - rebecca west,  the only sin passion can commit is to be joyless. - dorothy l.,  sayers,  the voice of passion is better than the voice of reason. the,  passionless cannot change history. - czeslaw milosz,  any man who can drive safely while kissing a pretty girl is simply,  not giving the kiss the attention it deserves. - albert,  einstein,  the decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any,  love story. it changes the relationship of two people much more,  strongly than even the final surrender; because this kiss already,  has within it that surrender. - emil ludwig,  a kiss is the upper persuasion for a lower invasion. - anon,  where should one use perfume? a young woman asked. wherever one,  wants to be kissed, i said. - coco chanel,  a legal kiss is never as good as a stolen one. - guy de,  maupassant,  soul meets soul on lovers lips. - percy bysshe shelley,  kisses are like tears, the only real ones are the ones you cant,  hold back. - anon,  stolen kisses require an accomplice. - anon,  i ran up the door, opened the stairs, said my pajamas and put on,  my prayers - turned off my bed, tumbled into my light, and all,  because he kissed me good-night! - unknown,  dont have sex man. it leads to kissing and pretty soon you have,  to start talking to them. - steve martin,  ,  i have lots more quotes but youre not in a library, or your,  favorite nook, reading a treasured book. this is a profile, not a,  novel. ill give you more if you ask, but theres more ground to,  cover in this profile if i am to reveal myself as fully as possible,  with only the written word. the remainder of the revelation will,  have to wait until we meet. but first, one last quote ( which i,  shamelessly stole from another okc member whom i found captivating,  and alluring): there are only four questions of value...what is,  sacred? what is the spirit made of? what is worth living for, and,  dying for? the answer for each is the same. only love." - johnny,  depp from the movie don juan de marco.,  ,  im not crazy about the overly casual mode of dress that seems to,  have overtaken our culture. everyone seems to be wearing sweats,  these days. i wear them too, but never in public. and its a rare,  day that i even wear jeans in public. seems like there are more and,  more candidates for an intervention by tracy and clinton every day.,  enough! time to show a little class when out in public.,  ,  i am highly tactile, visual, oral, aural, and olfactoral. i live in,  the senses, for the sensory. i sometimes sit for hours, lights low,,  phone unplugged, and listen to jazz. its a musical form that is,  not wallpaper. it demands your attention. i listen until the music,  enters me.,  ,  i believe that lovemaking begins with hello. it progresses with,  glances, whispers, light touches (the skin is the most sensitive of,  erogenous zones), laughter, teasing, double entendres, a shared,  meal of food eaten with ones hands, dancing close at halftime to,  the beat, a few sweet kisses. it is high art in a world in which,  most people are streetsweepers.',

      'welcome to my profile:) this must be what the beauty pageant ladies,  feel like when they get interviewed and have to tap dance and shine,  on command. let me start by saying, i really do want world,  peace.,  my family is the most important part of my life, we drive each,  other nuts and are supportive when it counts (and when nobody else,  would care).,  i was born and raised in oakland then went off to school in the,  northwest (stayed and worked for 8 years). if my family was not,  here in the bay area i would still live up there, because the land,  is so beautiful and open. there is no place like home, so i had to,  move back (time for a big yawn...you still with me? ok).,  i have one older sister and two best friends who are like sisters,  to me. love, love, love.,  ,  my sense of humor is how i maintain a sane life. random things,  strike me funny. not too long ago i was working in a classroom and,  one of the second grade boys was doodling on his worksheet. he drew,  a stick figure man with a huge speech bubble coming out of the butt,  with the word "fart". i think he thought i would be mad but i make,  it my mission in life to be totally honest with kids and farts are,  funny, hands down! i told him this and said he was a good artist,,  the look on his face was priceless.,  i enjoy hearing and telling stories. my dad grew up in philly and i,  love hearing his stories about his old neighborhood. if you check,  out "the moth" or the "story corps" project you can get a good idea,  of what i love about everyday life and how a person sharing their,  story can completely affirm or change my outlook on life (wow you,  are good if you have actually read this whole thing:).',

      '** note **,  im currently not overly active on okc lately due to a) casually,  seeing someone and b) being pretty busy socially. this isnt to say,  im not interested in new friends or potential partners, but sadly,  im also not responding very much because of it. if you see,  something interesting, please feel free to drop an email but also,  please dont hold your breath. i promise to check out profiles of,  emails i get, but im limiting responses to people that *really*,  intrigue me.,  ,  i describe myself as a pessimistic optimist. even when im down, i,  can see the light up ahead, its just making it there that is the,  struggle. im not content with staying down though so no matter how,  much you kick me, ill still get up, probably telling you off and,  finding something else to occupy my time.,  ,  im a <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=gamer">gamer</a>, a,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=vegetarian">vegetarian</a> with,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=vegan+tendencies">vegan,  tendencies</a>, an <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=animal+rights+activist">animal rights activist</a>,  (not militant about it, i believe in living and letting live). i,  enjoy <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=reading">reading</a> and,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=cooking">cooking</a> as a,  hobby. i also am a bike commuter... if its anywhere within 15 to,  20 miles, ill bike instead of taking a car or public transit.,  doing this with a load of groceries on your back isnt as fun as it,  sounds but i sold my car in 2006 and have had no regrets.,  ,  i love pets and two <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=cats">cats</a> run my life. if i had the space, i,  would have more cats and probably a few <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=dogs">dogs</a> to throw into the mix. ive also had,  several african pygmy hedgehogs as pets.,  ,  im not a big sports person, but i do enjoy <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=cycling">cycling</a> and <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=yoga">yoga</a>. i used to cross-country cycle,  regularly, but the lack of trails in downtown san francisco kinda,  put a halt on that sport. ive played amateur competitive <a class=,  "ilink" href="/interests?i=paintball">paintball</a> in the past as,  well, but going back to university to finish my <a class="ilink",  href="/interests?i=computer+science">computer science</a> degree,  meant i had to quit. ive not found a group of friends interested,  in playing regularly since and i left all my gear back up in,  canada.,  ,  yes, i am <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=canadian">canadian</a>. ive been in sf for almost,  four years, but i am still very much a canuck at heart. if you,  listen, you will catch me saying aboot and eh. i can appreciate a,  good joke, but serious bashing about "americas tophat" will put me,  on the defensive. i love my country dearly.,  ,  i am moderate to heavily into <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=bodyart">bodyart</a>. i have seven <a class="ilink",  href="/interests?i=tattoos">tattoos</a>, one of which is a very,  large calf tattoo. im also in the process of having a large back,  piece done. id say its about half finished (picture in the,  picture section). i have 24 <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=piercings">piercings</a>, not all of which are in my,  ears. i also have a <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=scarification">scarification</a> piece done on my,  back. i like to colour my hair pretty regularly and can go easily,  between my natural blonde to brown, black, natural-looking red,,  punk red, blue, purple, or whatever else strikes my fancy.,  sometimes i even mix it up with two colours just for fun. blood red,  and black was my favourite combination. on the flip side, i,  actually suck at fashion in general and sometimes i wonder how i,  manage to dress myself in the mornings. fashion faux pas? thats,  me.,  ,  i graduated university with a computer science degree and have had,  a range of jobs from programmer to computer forensic analyst. im,  currently a web programmer at a well-established startup in the,  financial district, but my job is not my life. i enjoy what i do, i,  love my coworkers tonnes, but i like to leave work at work and have,  fun when the office closes. i can be serious about my job and,  career when i need to be, but im not at that point in my life,  right now.,  ,  i love to <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=dance">dance</a>,,  which i dont do enough of. i want to get out to the clubs more and,  just dance for hours (only industrial, goth or ebm music though, i,  dance like a drunken chicken to other styles). i tend to frequent,  either the cat club or dna lounge (typically on goth, industrial or,  trance nights). i like to party but im not a partier. i can enjoy,  myself in crowds or in small groups. im also quite happy being,  alone and play video games (mainly <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=world+of+warcraft">world of warcraft</a>) when i feel,  like it. which admittedly can be quite a lot. my gamedrug of choice,  is rpgs, but only wow has me for the mmorpgs. i shall save my soul,  for it.,  ,  i am eclectic, unpredictable, and colourful',

      "i am an attorney practicing in san francisco and residing in,  greenbrae. i represent policyholders in coverage disputes with,  their insurers. i was raised in orlando and schooled in tallahassee,  (fsu) with degrees in history and law. i emigrated from florida,  right after law school and have since lived in san francisco and,  south marin. i have two brothers, a younger one who followed me out,  here and lives in marin and an elder who remained in florida.,  ,  my goal a match. my reason for wanting that is probably the same as,  yours: with a little help from our friends an unshared life can be,  great fun once youve mastered the art, and yet is not to be,  compared to life and memories shared with one who is dear to you.,  its better with a girl. a lot better.,  ,  off the job my passions are, in no order: 1) history - western civ,  and us, all periods. much of my reading is related to history; 2),  travel in europe - most of my vacations have been spent in europe,  or nyc. i am open to traveling in other areas but am drawn to great,  cities; 3) art and the history thereof - particularly painting, one,  of the reasons for my interest in european travel; 4) movies a,  buff; all types except action films and animation; 5) shakespeare ,  im trying to set up a shakespeare reading club. if i succeed it,  will by my third; 6) food and drink convicted hedonist; 7),  politics and foreign affairs - if you dont enjoy politics these,  days then you just have no appreciation for farce, or perhaps i,  should say tragi-comedy. my politics are center-left, and im about,  as moderate as that sounds except that i regard far-righties as,  hicks and ignoramuses. 8) music intense lover of almost all,  types, including the american songbook, but not post-eighties pop,  or anything resembling rap; 9) humor all forms, not just,  republicans, though we do owe them so much in this area; the genius,  of stewart and colbert, and maher. 9) this above all, the,  conversation of friends. love to meet yours.,  ,  i seem to have an affinity with nyc, as i am a regular reader of,  nyt, new yorker magazine and the new york review of books. as to,  books, current reading includes heisenbergs war, freakonomics,,  muhammad and the believers, a biography of mussolini, sacred,  pleasure and travel books on vienna, which i will visit in october,  with my son.,  ,  im supposed to describe the girl im looking for - her qualities -,  but im not sure i can. obviously we must share some values and,  interests, the more the better, which is why i have laid mine out,  at such length. but as to personal traits i just dont know. if,  its right well know. how that works is still a mystery. - mam",

      "hello and thank you for your interest in me as a potential friend,  or romantic partner. id like to focus first on the kind of,  relationship im wishing to create. sharing a passion for a similar,  ideal of relationship is more attractive to me than a particular,  age, race or body type.,  ,  tenderness: i dont fit the typical stereotype of a guy. i am very,  effective at what i do (built my first custom house on time and on,  budget at age 24, for example, acting as my own contractor) and,  mentally very intelligent. however, i use these skills to create,  serenity, harmony, avoid unnecessary conflict and create a,  micro-climate that supports emotional tenderness, appreciation,,  reflection and beauty. on a relationship level i am most interested,  in how you treat your inner children, your kindness with yourself,  and others and the priority you place on a quiet joy with,  another.,  ,  depth and togetherness: i enjoy beginning a relationship with the,  generous time needed for full transparency emotionally, mentally,  and logistically. i can feel kindness when it is present almost,  instantly and hope you can do the same. the more aware and visible,  two kind people are the more consciously and skillfully we can,  navigate around or sooth each others tender sides and bring value.,  i like to consciously create containers that provide generous time,  to explore each others faces mentally, emotionally, physically and,  spiritually. to do this it is best if both people have at least an,  hour a day particularly in the building period of getting to know,  one another and an average of thirty hours each week to ebb and,  flow without external pressures.,  ,  conscious collaboration: it is wonderful when the two of us,  naturally flow into a dance that is highly rewarding and satisfying,  to both people. i appreciate this element in a relationship to some,  degree. just as importantly i want to collaborate to co-create,  conscious value sexually, emotionally, mentally and in our daily,  logistics. i find it enormously satisfying to take the time to,  communicate what optimal looks like for each of us and then,  collaborate as a team to bring more of this into our relationship.,  the willingness and ability to coach and be coached is a key skill,  needed to do this well.,  ,  celebrating our unique well-being: i appreciate a self-aware,  partner who understands and is willing to go for what makes her,  deeply happy. this is an infinite path and one i enjoy working on,  together. i have lived most of my life outside of convention and,  find that the willingness to put personal values and unique,  strategies ahead of trying to look or be normal is one of my keys,  to happiness. i would love to connect with others who are also free,  to seek happiness beyond convention.,  ,  integrity: i find it particularly important in our diverse culture,  to take the time to co-create agreements and understandings that,  support both of us in meeting our needs and experiencing our values,  fully within the relationship. i feel that the skill to communicate,  in ways needed to form clear agreements based on win/win and then,  keep those agreements and renegotiate them responsibly as the,  relationship grows is vital. i want the kind or relationship in,  which we can rely upon each other to bring up anything that needs,  to be said, to speak the full truth, to keep our commitments and,  not to make commitments that are not in alignment with our hearts,  desires. this obviously takes time to do well in the moment and i,  wish to be with someone that puts this respect and integrity above,  all else in our lives. i am looking for a partner interested in,  creating a relationship that deserves to come first in both our,  lives and that is given first priority. i have set up the logistics,  of my life to be able to meet you here.,  ,  staying present now: i want our relationship to feed our souls, to,  bring us deep joy, inspiration and well-being now. i have loved,  several very beautiful women, inside and out. having done,  joint-therapy with five of them my therapist tells me i have great,  taste in incredible women. i would have been happy if any one of,  those women had stayed with me for the rest of my life. this is not,  my highest value however. my highest value is the daily, weekly and,  yearly assessment: is this relationship taking each of us where we,  want to go? is it supporting us in being who we want to be? can we,  make adjustments to see that it does and are we willing to do so?,  whether for a week, a month, a year or decades, i come into,  relationship when the two of us believe and experience that doing,  so takes us closer to our values. i end relationship when i do not,  see or experience this for both people. i do not consider death to,  be a failure and appreciate the vitality that comes from honestly,  exploring the question: does spending time together each day bring,  us more value than any other thing we could be doing? if not, why,  not? are we ok with that or do we want to reinvent our relationship,  so that it does? immediacy is a very high value of mine. something,  that is true and gets communicated while im feeling it is a great,  experience. within the next 24 hours its ok and beyond that it,  begins to feel stale and intimacy starts to diminish.,  ,  appreciation and affection: my first three love languages in this,  order are: words of praise, quality time and touch. to feel loved i,  need verbal appreciation, spacious time to connect and touch.,  because i get a fairly good read on someone within a few hours i am,  often fairly fast with affection if i feel safe and it is nice to,  be met there. i enjoy leisurely relationships in which we take the,  time each day to appreciate what we love about one another and to,  enjoy sexual and sensual affection. i notice that i dont have a,  courting and honeymoon stage that wears off. i am just as,  affectionate several years into a relationship as i am at the,  beginning sometimes more so because i get turned on more by,  emotional closeness than i do by anything else.,  ,  personal growth and spirituality: i am passionate about learning,  exceptional relationship skills and have published several books on,  the subject as part of my own education (i learn best by teaching).,  it was an incredible discovery when i experienced natural sacred,  states of insight and consciousness arising out of bringing our,  energy bodies into love-making. i have learned so much in the past,  eight years since i made relationship skills the focus of my,  life-long learning program. i want to meet someone who shares my,  passion to learn and experience new things on all dimensions. i,  have always found i learn best with beginners mind. i appreciate,  you for joining me there.",

if youve got a <b>moped</b> id love to blast,  with you.,  ,  <b>long distance pen pals:</b> so what if you live a few states,  away? i love talking to people who generally want to befriend me.,  that said, if were going to talk, <b>please be literate. this goes,  for anyone i talk to.</b> while i might say things like, "y hello,  thar," or ,"teh fhecks you doin?", that doesnt mean i dont like,  full, literate conversations. as you can see from reading this,  profile, (shit, you are still reading, arent you?) i like to be,  well spoken, and i cant stand too much of, "hey, wuts good? im,  chillin @ home wer r u?" no offense to people to who text talk, but,  i just cant stand to read it too long. a little bits okay, i just,  dont want to have to decipher what the fuck youre trying to,  say.,  ,  <b>sex partners: before you make assumptions,</b> just because i am,  <i>also</i> seeking sex partners does not mean i am <i>only</i>,  seeking sex partners. now, i said i hate the term casual,  encounters but that doesnt mean i like sex partners either. i,  like to bundle this term loosely with friends because if i just,  plain dont like someone im having sex with and that doesnt,  change, im probably not going to have sex with that person much,  longer. i prefer that my partners are at least friends. now for my,  ever-present, "<b>this does not in any way, shape, form, or,  definition mean that we are dating or in a committed,  relationship.</b>" friends can have sex. in my opinion, theres,  nothing wrong with experiencing pleasure with a friend. and... the,  nitty gritty. <b>i am completely std free, and i am tested,  regularly.</b> obviously, you should be too. condoms are a must. i,  definitely believe in safe and sane play, and id really prefer,  anyone who is seeking sex be capable of having open communication,  about it. ya know, stuff like what works, what doesnt, boundaries,,  etc. <b>while i like to say im experienced (i certainly think i,  am, and ive had no complaints), there is a lot that i havent,  tried, so creativity is a big plus. im willing to try almost,  anything.</b> in case you cant tell, <b>im not a boy,  scout.</b>,  ,  <b>remember that part about tmi having lost authority?</b>,  ,  <b>as a general note, any time youre uncomfortable or have,  something on your mind that you want to tell me, let me know. id,  rather you risk my feelings be hurt than disappear over something,  that could just be resolved in an adult fashion.</b>,  ,  ***,  ,  <b>other things im interested in</b>,  ,  <b>geminis:</b> as you can see, im a <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=gemini">gemini</a> and very serious about it. whats,  this mean?

(yeah, i know youre,  giggling right now because youre thinking of yourself and going,,  "oooooooh.. teehee" <b>im onto your ass.</b>) at the same time, i,  love you and embrace you with more open arms than possibly anyone,  else. <b>if its a friendship youre after, you got it, if its a,  date, sure, if its a relationship, im a little cautious, but you,  know exactly why, and if its sex, its probably gonna happen at,  the drop of a hat.</b>,  ,  <b>dragons (chinese zodiac):</b> because of your likely brazen,,  bold, and firm nature, as well as my brazen, bold, and firm nature,  <b>its a likelihood that we will argue and compete a lot.</b>,  thats not a bad thing though. its good to be able to defend a,  stance against someone youre already friends with. <b>strangers,  may not exchange the time of day, but friends can argue for hours,  and still be happy.</b>,  ,  ***,  ,  <b>a few other things</b>,  ,  so, this section was an afterthought. heres a few random,  things.,  ,  -stephen colbert is a man-like demigod.

      "ive been living in oakland since november 09. before that id,  spent my whole life in chicago (well, the relatively near burbs,  til i was 18). i pretty quickly became a fan of this magical place,  known as california. im still really loving the year round hiking,  and farmers markets. and the fact that you get free samples of,  fruit at those markets. although - just a little bit - i do miss,  snow. and - a little bit more - i miss real seasons. im still,  having fun exploring the bay area at large and would love to find,  someone to do more of that with. i also love how close so many,  other interesting to see places are. you can drive for an hour and,  see a whole new world.,  ,  im a pubs and random neighborhood bars over clubs kinda girl;,  local, independent restaurants and stores over chains. i cant seem,  to get enough of the ocean and mountains, smile at the eerie beauty,  of the fog in the hills every morning and am giddy at sunny,  afternoons in february. (yes, for better or worse and whatever it,  says about me, both of those things are literally true.) i think,  netflix and libraries are both great things, i like that they have,  a big box of neckties that you can use instead of buying a yoga,  strap at the class at the y, but also maintain a pretty healthy,  amazon wishlist and never run out of things that i could buy at,  target.,  ,  and im the almost always happy-to-be-there and only occasionally,  overly stressed managing director of a professional non-profit,  theatre company in berkeley. i love theatre in general, but also,  what i do: helping make theatre, thinking about how to sell,  theatre, watching an audience watch theatre and be moved, engaged,,  entertained. there are a number of things about me that make it the,  right job for me and, often, an otherwise good person and friend:,  im logical and detailed and just a little romantic. plus i like to,  take care of people and things in all sorts of little ways.",

(it requires learning a whole new language in san,  francisco. i cant bring myself to say "im not in that space right,  now" or "im having a hard time." i lament that im some kind of,  steinbeck character but seriously, you kids, fuck your pretty,  lies.) but--and im totally cockblocking myself with the,  self-destructive gals to write these next four words, damn it--i am,  usually kind. when i sense a human on the other end of the line i,  am humane. i am even very loyal to friends, probably unwisely. i am,  generous of matter and spirit. market forces want to treat us as,  chattel and i am possessed by hubris. i let it take me for the,  power that it gives. it is a symbiote.,  ,  so listen. i go to play parties. i need openness and freedom and,  newness. (my apprentice puts it, "you just need that rando,  factor.") i think marriage for love is as retarded as soy meat and,  i find the idea of cohabiting an even more terrifying dead end,  (well become irritable and indifferent like poorly housed,  hamsters). but i do want intimacy. i want it more than i ever have.,  ive learned this about myself: im most likely to give it to,  someone whos happy and hip and street-smart but also stunningly,  kind and good to people. a kindergarten teacher type.,  ,  i just got off a nonstop thrill ride of a relationship and,  community and im working on optimizing my life like ive never,  been inspired to before. instead of reading on my muni commute i,  sit there thinking and taking notes about what to bring to this or,  that party and how to engage n new friend. im either maturing or,  mutating.,  ,  that means i need bouncy bitches. bouncy bitches who provide things,  like:,  ,  never-ending light,  demolitions,  no-nonsense nymphomania,  ,  i like staying profound, pithy and light with absurdity. come get a,  catchy designation.',

      'being single in the bay area is no easy task. everyone is so busy,,  that the only place to meet people is in the gym or safeway. but,  who, in his right mind, would do that? so here i am on a dating,  sight. not only am i single, but i am also a single dad. i have two,  kids girl and boy, 12 and 14. i gotta tell you, that people my age,  are grand parents. so its doubly difficult for me to find a,  partner. i was married for 14 years. the one thing i learned from,  my divorce is that every one has the right to pursue their,  happiness. even your ex. and so i am looking for my happiness. i,  dont need you to co-parent my kids. i am an expert father. i dont,  need a wife. what id like to find is a partner in life. some one,  that will allow her self to be loved and could return the,  favor.,  ,  i dont watch tv and i rarely rent dvds. i am verbal, not visual.,  that makes me a good conversation partner, but not some one you,  want to go see a movie with. my knowledge of pop culture is almost,  none existent.,  ,  post-reproductive dating:,  since i have been meeting only divorced women i thought id add,  this note. this is second time around for me. meaning that i have,  been married once before. the marriage satisfied my need to be a,  parent. i can change diapers, do laundry, kiss a boo-boo and read,  kids to sleep. it satisfied my need to be a spouse. we shared,  property in common, we shared bank accounts and credit cards. this,  time around, is different. it is different because the union,  between me and you will not be based on having more kids. we are,  not going to share bank accounts, credit cards, nor are we buying,  property in common. the more time passes between the divorce and,  now, the more clarity one gets on ones life. for this second, long,  term relationship to work both of us have to be brutally honest and,  painfully realistic. you (my potential mate) have to be at least as,  far along your journey of emotional development as i am. we are,  equals. this is a truly egalitarian relationship. you are,  emotionally sable. you are financially self-sufficient. you have,  been disabused of the notion that: "they lived happily ever after".,  you are not going to run away at the first sign of problems, but,  will give it you best to try and work things out. if you are still,  looking for a fairy tale, i am not your prince. i am just a man,,  seeking companionship with a like minded person.,  ,  i received a few very negative emails after adding the previous,  paragraph. i was accused of being both bitter and angry. i am,  neither. im actually a very easy going, non-demanding, optimistic,  person. i do, however, speak my mind. having been on this site on,  and off for the last three years, i came to the conclusion that,  laying all my cards on the table separates those who are truly,  interested in a relationship with an adult from those that treat,  this site like a candy store.,  ,  hobbies:,  i am an avid snow boarder. i used to swim long distance regularly,,  but my schedule changed so i havent done that. i try to visit the,  gym three times a week. i practice archery and consider my self,  pretty good at it, although my kids have pointed out that i,  couldnt hit the broad side of a barn.,  ,  p.s.,  i have been asked this several times: yes, the pictures are resent.',

      'quick note feb. 2012 : at the moment my personal calendar is more,  or less full. im always open to striking up a conversation, but,  im not likely to be open to much more than that at this,  time.,  ,  hi there! im a bit of a blend of disparate elements. one portion,  of me is the consummate ubergeek : i design electronics for a,  living (usually something that involves processing video and that,  has me thinking about implementation of complex realtime algorithms,  in very large, very fast fpgas) but the important thing is the,  aspect of creation. to me theres something immensely powerful,  about starting with an idea in one corner of my brain and through,  hard work and experimentation bringing it to life to fill some,  purpose. it doesnt have to be electronics - it could just as,  easily be carpentry (ive rebuilt a house in the past) but,  electronics pays better.,  ,  the flip side is somebody who enjoys <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=dancing">dancing</a> a fair amount either as a,  performer or just for my own pleasure. i do a bit of <a class=,  "ilink" href="/interests?i=improv">improv</a>, and in recent years,  have even sung a bit in front of audiences. the balance between the,  geek and the performer helps keep me (mostly) sane.,  ,  i read a little bit of everything but have an old love for sci fi,  and fantasy. i love <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=games">games</a> (computer, board or whatever) and,  will happily match you either at a long run of civilization or of,  catan. i havent watched tv for years (although dvds are a welcome,  periodic distraction). im a generalist by inclination - i love to,  know perhaps a few subjects in depth but also a little bit about a,  wide range of things. i am incessantly curious about all aspects of,  the nature of the world around us.,  ,  i am inquisitive, playful, and adventurous',

      'this is one of the most difficult things to do. to say who we are,  on a screen, using only words. no expression, no gestures, no,  intense engagement, not a sense of energy, of chemistry. and, to be,  honest, i feel that most people base everything on the things that,  ultimately dont matter. (my opinion, and some statistics,  haha),  i am someone who strives to be the best i can be, in whatever i do.,  i love to learn, to evolve, to share, to care, to laugh and i am,  looking for someone similar. i expect there to be differences but,  not necessarily in basic values and goals. my goal, if i can call,  it that is to be with someone that wants to make a difference in,  this world, not just her own little world. to create something,  together. its not about me or her, but about we and us. i am not,  conventional in my thinking. i think and feel outside the box, and,  even though i dont always succeed, i continue to be aware, and try,  to learn from my mistakes. my partner would be someone who speaks,  her mind, who has something to say, can say it with feeling and,  conviction. i promise i will listen. someone who can communicate,  her innermost feelings, desires, and wants. i am quite comfortable,  socially, and i like to explore different venues, whether that,  means trying new foods, new activities, new ways of thinking or,  just simply being open. i am aware of my imperfections, but i dont,  see them as such. they are just opportunities to better who i am. i,  do not need to be in a relationship, i choose to be in a,  relationship. i am not looking for someone who finds their,  happiness in external things. for ex. money, material things, a,  provider, etc.. i do feel in a lot of ways, its not possible to be,  happy with someone else, unless we are happy with who we are. so,,  in other words, its all about putting in our best effort to create,  a space of happiness, love , care, peace, passion for our partners,,  not only thinking about our egos.,  i will continue to elaborate on this section, but i will end in,  saying that life can be long, but it can also be short. we really,,  really, really never know when we are finished with the body that,  is currently on loan. so, in searching for truth and striving to be,  "real", i hope you will do the same.,  just in ending: first of all, if you havent read this far, i guess,  it doesnt matter lol , but if youre reading this. and theres a,  basic, decent, honest, human to human connection? meaning, a simple,  response would be very much appreciated. if youre interested,,  great---if youre not, great, just the same. whats due to me will,  come to me, so if its not meant to be, its not meant to be.,  thanks for reading',

      'i identify as an icosahedron. i think its kind of sad that i cant,  put a picture of an icosahedron where okcupid looks for a picture,  of me, but i understand, because thats not actually what i look,  like. the name "icosahedron" was taken and "theicosahedron" seems,  too self-important, as if there is only one in all of existence.,  maybe its in platos cave somewhere.,  ,  also, i am not really a straight man, in a lot of conventional,  senses of the word. but im afraid of other men hitting on me. this,  is why i tell okcupid im straight. if i had the option i would put,  "its complicated" for both gender and sexual orientation, but this,  isnt facebook, and facebook only allows "its complicated" as a,  gender anyway.,  ,  when i got my job someone referred to me as a "smart-ass berkeley,  statistician" and i am trying to embrace this label. i call myself,  a "mathologist" because it sounds less serious than "mathematician",  and i think most mathematicians take themselves too seriously. i,  want to write a "cheerful mathematics manifesto" but im not sure,  what it would say.,  ,  im extrinsically demotivated. if you try to tell me that i should,  want to do something i dont want to do it.,  ,  im torn between trying to not be like everybody else and trying to,  not be like all the people who are trying to not be like everybody,  else.',

(i came up with that all on my,  own),  i am a hard worker and upbeat person with a naturally optimistic,  outlook on life. i have a great career that i love but does not,  define who i am. i own up to my own responsibilities. and can admit,  when i am wrong. i also expect others to take responsibility for,  their own actions.,  i have been told i am a very intense person with a lot of good,  energy. i really feel like i am a good friend but i am not out of,  anyones league. i believe that nobody is as good as i am but, i am,  better than no one else.,  my father is the type father that every person should have in their,  lives. he has incredible wit, integrity and foresight. i hope some,  has rubbed off onto me and down to my two boys.i have a large,  family of 8 brothers and sisters ( straight from 8).,  i have 2 boys that live out of state with their mothers. yes i said,  it, mothers as in plural. i am on good terms with the mothers and,  will not change that for anyones insecurities.,  ,  i am not arnold schwarzenegger by any means but, i am in very good,  shape for my age. i look a good 8-10 years younger than i am and i,  would like to meet someone who takes care of themselves, i try to,  eat right and stay active. with that being said no couch potatoes,  please,  ,  i am probably not going to be interested in anyone more than 10,  years older or younger than i, thats even stretching it a little.,  i do have tattoos and that bothers some people, thats ok having,  some ink does not define who i am and if you are going to judge me,  by that then you would not be for me anyway.,  ,  i am open to dating any race, religion or political belief. i think,  that we as people may have more in common with each other than,  differences.i would prefer a down to earth demure type woman. you,  dont need to be a barbie doll. it does me no good if someone is,  very attractive but has the brains, personality, or attitude if a,  toilet seat. however i do watch what i eat and get regular exercise,  and want someone who does the same.,  i like ambitious people that can hold a good conversation /debate,  with me. the mind is a muscle also.",

      "hello!,  *ive been on this site for a few weeks and i must say im,  impressed with the quality of writing ive been finding on many of,  the profiles. i will try to express who i am as eloquently as i,  can, but i cant promise it will be the best thing youve read on,  here.*,  ,  my husband and i are in an open relationship. i like boys and,  girls, but im not looking for anything very serious.,  ,  im basically optimistic, but not an idealist. i can definitely see,  the value in meditation, positive thinking, and yoga, but im not,  some kind of unhygienic, preachy hippy and im certainly not,  looking for one.,  ,  i spend maybe too much time on the internet. i think the internet,  is the greatest thing ever invented and i envy those who grew up,  with it.,  ,  ive led an interesting life, and i still go out and do interesting,  things, but im more mellow now than ive been in years. also,  happier.,  ,  ive been a goth and a raver. ive been to burning man twice.we,  love making and/or assembling costumes and going to costume-y,  events.,  ive tried, but i cant really play an instrument. i can sing,,  though.,  ,  i desire the interesting, unusual, and humorous. i have a phobia of,  being bored.,  ,  there are so many things that interest me (history, linguistics,,  sociology, literature), but most of them dont necessarily lead to,  a lucrative career, so its hard to justify spending a bunch of,  time and money on a degree. in the meantime i educate myself about,  things that interest me by researching on the internets and reading,  books.,  ,  ive lived in the bay area on and off for 11 years. mostly in san,  francisco. we just moved to east bay in feb of 10. im originally,  from the san diego area. my family is still there. usually if i,  travel thats where i go. we have plans to go to comiccon this,  year.,  ,  in my youth i traveled to japan and europe twice. ive traveled,  across this country too, hawaii and alaska too. travelling is one,  of my favorite things, and i want to do more of it.,  ,  it fulfills me to cultivate life. i have a nurturing side. i love,  gardening and keeping my tropical fish and aquatic snails. i have,  quite a few houseplants.",

      'i am looking for a chill dude who is emotionally-aware,,  kind-hearted, an animal lover, usually cheerful, quietly,  thoughtful, smart about his passions, and generally optimistic -,  im kind of a female version of that.,  ,  my vibe -,  i take each day as it comes, doing the best i can to be the best,  person i can be at any given moment. i tend to live intensely - as,  in, i seem to feel the emotions of everyday life quite vibrantly. i,  laugh easily, i cry easily, i am honest, i sympathize well, i get,  angry but can never hold a grudge...you get the idea. long ago i,  wanted to study literature, and i think its because i am drawn to,  things that are poignant and profound. i am good at small talk in,  those crowded party situations, but its really the deeper,  connections in life that i love to explore. i find some element of,  beauty in almost everything. downtown oakland is beautiful to me,  because everyday i walk by people who look so hardened to life, who,  have so many cares written across their faces, and yet are,  spontaneously warm when i simply open my mouth. that kind of,  grittiness and generosity humbles me. amy winehouse was beautiful,  because she was unrelentingly real. people fixate on her tattoos,,  drinking, and beehive, but wasnt it obvious that she had a heart,  that was incredibly pure and brave. death can be beautiful because,  it teaches us to value life.,  ,  those are the kinds of thoughts that go through my head quite,  naturally. but im often surprised by how much people shy away from,  talk that touches them. so, for most of the world, i am cheerful,  and active or quiet and mundane - that is also me, just not all of,  me - but my closest people understand my default frequency.,  ,  still there? more?,  ,  my other passions since childhood have been nature, animals, and,  the environment. it is ironic because i am in a career that often,  requires me to seclude myself inside a library or windowless,  office. it is also ironic because, while i have an activist bent,  toward those topics, my chosen career highly values objective,  research and scholarship. so, i live in contradictions. but i think,  the psyche works in strange ways, such that what we think doesnt,  make sense at all actually makes sense. as in - i should have been,  a writer + i should be an advocate for animals + i am addicted to,  understanding things from all points of view, which is as close to,  objectivity as we can ever get = i write in a scholarly field that,  makes me question my biases while researching the topics that,  excite me. and the amazing thing about the human urge is that shit,  like that falls into place rather unconsciously for, i think,,  everyone.,  ,  or, i am incredibly privileged to be able to think through such,  options in the first place, and most people do what they must. no,,  i dont completely believe that. every person has some element of,  agency.,  ,  the mundane -,  i live in oakland with my fuzzies, farley and misha. jackson,,  another fuzzy, died about six weeks ago, so i have been trying to,  figure out what connection a box of ashes has to the breathing,,  jumping, loud, i-love-you-so-much beautiful hunk of a cat i shared,  my life with everyday. its weird.,  ,  i study political science and am working on getting a ph.d. "what,  are you going to do with that?" you ask. hopefully one day i will,  become a professor in one of my favorite cities in the u.s.,  ,  given the funds and time, i love to travel - really, who doesnt?,  but people vary wildly in where they choose to go and what they do.,  my vacations tend to include museums, cities, natural landscapes,,  national parks, and tourist sites - ideally all, but roughly in,  that order of preference. i have been to taiwan, hong kong,,  thailand, vietnam, cambodia, malaysia, singapore, laos, china,,  guatemala, london and paris very briefly, and not nearly enough,  states in the u.s. i love the ocean.,  ,  i need zen space from time to time to, you know, get in touch with,  my inner goddess. that includes things like snuggling in bed all,  day with novels, aimless grocery shopping, people watching, and,  really girlie stuff like facials and painting my nails. i like that,  feeling of tired accomplishment after a productive day.,  ,  when i laugh, it might be a girlish giggle, an undignified cackle,,  or a deep rumble from the belly. sometimes i can be funny, but i,  think youll be funnier. i promise not to make you work hard for my,  guffaws.',

      'hi there. hows your day going so far? im glad you stopped by- i,  always like meeting interesting people, and havent met a person,  who wasnt interesting in some way or another. i like your outfit:,  it works for you. but enough about you, lets face it. youre here,  because you want to know about me.,  ,  lets save us both some time and start with whats probably the,  deal breaker for most of you:,  ,  after eight wonderful years of monogamy, my wife <a class="plink",  href="/profile/blissfullypoly">blissfullypoly</a> and i decided to,  give each other the gift of <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=polyamory">polyamory</a> (<a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=polyamorous">polyamorous</a>, <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=poly">poly</a> for the search index). shes,  definitely my primary so if you cant respect her or that, then i,  wish you the best with your search. were not actively looking to,  date you together, so theres that, too.,  ,  what this means for you is i have no hidden agenda and dont have,  to play games (unless you have some fun ones to suggest). yes, my,  primary reason for being here is to get to the making out with,  awesome chicks part. but like i said, im not looking for someone,  to complete me in every way (i have that). im looking to fill my,  contact list with more cool peeps, so feel free to drop a note if,  youre looking for something more plutonic. even if this isnt a,  kissing book, itll still be a great read.,  ,  so theres that. if you love love, or just having fun with,  <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=awesome">awesome</a> guys,  (i.e.: me) read on.,  ,  im frank (some say blunt). i usually try to balance tact in there,,  but ultimately im a <a class="ilink" href=,  "/interests?i=truth">truth</a> seeker, and strive to be a truth,  speaker. because of that, i can come off as rough around the edges,,  but i clean up nicely when i need to.,  ,  i listen very carefully to what i want (i tend to read the entire,  menu before ordering). i dont need a consensus every time im with,  a group, and half the time ill just strike out on my own if,  everyone takes too long to make a decision. i love having options,  but theyre pretty useless if you dont choose one. a 75% solution,  today is almost always better than a 100% solution tomorrow.,  ,  i grew up on the east coast but have been in cali for ten years.,  im loving it but i do miss the seasons.,  ,  i love how the strand is the most firm when youre walking on it,  and how your balance erodes when you stand still.,  ,  i love the word detritus but hate actual detritus.,  ,  i love <a class="ilink" href="/interests?i=hugs">hugs</a>. if we,  end up going on a date, expect that unless you otherwise specify.',

"i would look for people who have it as well, and get in,  that community.",  ,  though butler is not representative of his generation, his,  lifestyle shows that barebacking is not exclusive to men who are,  avoiding transmitting or receiving the disease by practicing,  risk-reduction strategies. - sf weekly,  ,  i would hope for a relationship someday or merriage from a4a,  ,  learn my language or find someone else.',

      'the most perseverant philosophy ive come up with thus far is that,  everyone should enjoy life, however they can, with whomever they,  can, while they can, as much as they can.,  ,  sounds like a good premise to me.,  ,  im very observant, i laugh often, i care easily and i think,  constantly. i am an intensely empathic, logical, and sincere,  person. im often silent and pensive, and occasionally vocal and,  carefree. (this balance is shifting.) the philosophical bohemian,  and rational workaholic within me are constantly at war.,  ,  living a lot of different places (and thinking and reading a lot),  while growing up has given me a pretty open perspective on life,,  and im always looking to expand my mind further.,  ,  when it comes to relationships and life in general, im exploring.,  although i am not averse to the commitment, passion, or,  determination necessary of a long-term monogamous relationship, i,  want to try short-term and/or open relationships for now (and,,  perhaps, forever). considering the fact that ill only be in the,  bay area until mid-august, thats probably all that ill get,  involved in anytime soon anyway. besides, i think more in terms of,  connections than i do relationships.,  ,  i know i want intimacy and connection. i know i dont want,  marriage, children, or to "start a family". i know i want to,  explore my sexuality. i dont consider this to be a necessity for,  romantic involvement. i know i dont want to deal with the mostly,  ridiculous rules, standards, preconceptions, expectations and,  rituals u.s. culture associates with dating and romance. im very,  open, and willing to connect quickly if that openness is,  reciprocated. im done dealing with all forms of infectious,  mental/emotional negativity for a while.,  ,  im a huge fan of open, truthful communication, in almost any,  context.',

      "happy, high energy, healthy, lucky and grateful .... i am a,  semi-retired school teacher who had to take dummy english at cal,  but works part time at a terrific job working one to one with at,  risk high schoolers . we meet in unconventional settings like,  cafes, the gym, or a museum. i always learn more from them than i,  teach and love the way they challenge my values and me. i am a,  member of many groups like the weeklywanderers for walking, the,  blistersisters for running, green sangha for buddhist environmental,  activism and california retired teachers to save our schools and,  our teachers. this past year i have been lucky enough to explore,  the temples around angkor wat, go snorkeling in the maldives, hike,  the dolomites guided by one of my ex foreign student roommates and,  bike the danube. i also went on jewish walking tours of london,,  venice, vienna (while reading the hare with amber eyes) and this,  was very significant for me since i grew up with hitler in the,  closet.. i see that as a gift because it has made me a more,  compassionate , caring, and not taking things for granted person. i,  have an adult son and am lucky enough to have a great relationship,  with him. several years ago he invited me to an 8 day silent,  retreat for which my friends thought i would need silver duct tape,  but they were wrong . then we went to india and nepal to follow the,  path of buddha and see the old cochin jewish community dating back,  to 69 ad. i have 2 favorite holidays, ground hog day and passover,  seder. i have a big, wonderful family so when it was my turn i,  cooked, with help, for 62. even when it is not my turn i often make,  the family version of matzah ball soup. i am intensely interested,  in what makes people tick. i hope to get back to editing this soon.,  my first attempt was more clever but i forgot to push save. i have,  a love , hate relationship with all this new technology but had,  real withdrawal when i didnt have my droid with texting, google,,  email, maps and so much more. now id really like to hear about,  you.",

      '(heres the hard part....talking about myself.),  here i am in all my randomness:,  im an optimist and a dreamer. i get distracted very easily. i,  speak broken spanish and can say "how are you?" in cantonese. im a,  bad storyteller because my brain thinks faster than my mouth can,  move. i could be really shy when i first meet people, but then,  again that really depends on the situation and the other people. my,  interests range from interior design to the san jose sharks to,  graphic novels to baking to art museums. im very easy-going. i,  hate drama. i dont like being the center of attention. i am,  patient and dont get mad easily except when im driving. i have,  road rage but only when i am in the car by myself and the windows,  are rolled up. other than that, i drive the speed limit and always,  make complete stops. i am convinced procrastination is in my blood.,  im goal-oriented and family-oriented. im a hard worker. i love,  the woods. tahoe and the redwoods are my to-go vacation spots. i,  love living in the city but sometimes i just want to hear nothing,  but the trees, to breath fresh air, and see stars. ive lived in sf,  since i was 4 but a part of me wants to experience another city,  before i settle down here. my dogs faces melt my heart every,  day.,  ,  top 3 things on my long bucket list:,  1) learn to fly a plane.,  2) see the coliseums and temples in europe.,  3) run a marathon.,  ,  i just want to meet a genuinely nice guy whom i have things in,  common with. someone to enjoy sporting events with but who will,  geek out on the dark night with me as well. someone i can have,  comfortable silences with. someone easy going.',

until i see proof otherwise... at last count totaling words on,  my profile "info" tab, and notes i have written yields over 17,000,  words. this does not count wall posts/comments i have made on other,  profiles/comments/photos.,  ,  my father was born gary fried, and adopted the surname paciocco,  after being raised by his step-father lou paciocco, whom i consider,  a full grandfather, much in the same way gary considered him a,  father. additionally, he gave my father the idea to call himself,  gary shore on tv as a stage name to prevent ethnic bias and for,  ease of pronunciation. given my 2 legal middle names, my full name,  is legitimately: michael louis kruger fried shore paciocco,,  proof:,  ,  this is louis pacioccos website detailing his entrepreneurial,  career as a live show producer, nightclub and restaurant,  owner:,  http://www.loupaciocco.com/,  ,  here is an article about my maternal grandfather, irving kruger, a,  notorious joke and pun teller until the day he died:,  http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/20025/octogenarian-keeps-em-laughing-at-s-f-jewish-home/,  ,  ,  here is an article on my paternal bio-grandfather martin fried, and,  accomplished director at the actors studio new york city:,  http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/06/arts/martin-fried-62-director-associated-with-actors-studio.html,  ,  ,  here is proof of my fathers impressive pioneering career as,  meteorologist gary shore:,  http://www.facebook.com/notes/michael-louis-kruger-paciocco/meteorologist-gary-shore/10150158851278709,  ,  ,  my first name came from a dog, a man, and an angel in equal,  parts.,  the dog was a mutt who was smart enough to speak.,  the man is an aeroscientist.,  the angel is the right hand of the lord. in hebrew - "who is like,  the lord?" most names are nouns, mine is a question, the,  answer?,  no one is like him.,  ,  i have also been called by friends: jew, jew-b, jewb, or jewball.,  to the extent that they would introduce me to strangers as,  such.,  ,  my religious views are quite complicated, i would say i am a,  spiritual judeo-christian person, not a religious one. the majority,  of professed christians fail to understand the most basic of,  christs ideas: love thy neighbor. "blessed are the poor in spirit,,  for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. blessed are they who mourn,,  for they will be comforted. blessed are the meek, for they will,  inherit the land. blessed are they who hunger and thirst for,  righteousness, for they will be satisfied. blessed are the,  merciful, for they will be shown mercy. blessed are the clean of,  heart, for they will see god. blessed are the peacemakers, for they,  will be called children of god. blessed are they who are persecuted,  for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.,  blessed are you when they insult you and persecute you and utter,  every kind of evil against you (falsely) because of me. rejoice and,  be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven. thus they,  persecuted the prophets who were before you." also, see the works,  of soren kierkegaard for more on false christianity (the kind which,  hates people, instead of loving them).,  ,  politically, i would call myself libertarian: anti-federal,  bureaucracy, anti-war, pro-market. people should govern themselves,,  and turn to those around them to settle disputes. from individual,,  to family, to local community, county, and state. not from the,  federal top down.,  ,  here are additional links:,  http://somethingawful.com/,  http://ytmnd.com/,  http://b3ta.com/,  http://ign.com/index/features.html,  http://omegle.com/,  http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/hyjal/cairnesharin/advanced,  ,  http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/cenarius/mozartlogosh/advanced,  ,  http://www.last.fm/user/ssbmang,  (check last.fm if you are a fan of music, its got my library of,  every song i am listening to all day every day.),  http://reddit.com',

      'well, ive tried to be more factual and open in my "self-summary",,  but the cute jokes just sort of appear by themselves...,  ,  1) i keep an unabridged dictionary under my bed, and i know how to,  use it (the dictionary, that is).,  2) have "pride and prejudice" just about memorized.,  3) favorite bumper sticker: "always remember you are unique, just,  like everybody else".,  4) am listening to "moby dick" on my ipod, not sure why, but how,  else can one make it through thirty pages of descriptions of the,  anatomical differences between the different species of,  whales...,  5) im still an incurable romantic.,  6) play jazz guitar badly. i used to be able to play the piano ok,,  i even attended a music conservatory briefly.,  7) ill never tell you about a great "cab" or talk about visiting,  the "wine country". these terms just seem pretentious to me.,  8) ive never been to prague and have no plans to do so, although,  that drops me out of the upscale man-about-town competition. most,  people here seem to have been to prague.,  9) ive been to india... viewing the poverty and suffering is a,  life-changing experience.,  10) i agree with bertrand russells "why i am not a christian".,  also with steven frys amazing speech on the same subject.,  11) i am slender and strong.,  12) i am constant, faithful, and loyal.,  13) i sometimes listen to p.g. wodehouse stories on my iphone as i,  fall asleep. hugh laurie says that p.g. wodehouse saved his,  life.,  14) i have one ph.d. and almost have another. i just like,  learning.,  15) i have had about 1500 ballet classes.,  16) im mostly vegetarian, but not fanatic.,  17) ive never applied for a job without receiving an offer.,  18) i have worked for a two failed startups. not my fault.,  19) i have never told anyone "its your fault". i dont believe in,  that,  way of thinking. everyone tries.,  20) id so much like to have a partner for the (partner required),  acro yoga class on valentines weekend. (all levels are ok).,  ,  yoga is becoming my passion as i get older. i used to be a ballet,  dancer, and now it is yoga and running that is keeping me strong,  and flexible. i love the bit of spirituality and sense of community,  that is sometimes a part of yoga classes. i dont know much yet,  about eastern philosophy, but i would love to find a partner who,  would be interested in finding out more about this. who will go to,  bali with me for a yoga retreat?,  ,  the most important attribute to me is kindness. and the kind of,  unselfishness that shows itself a dozen ways in every day that you,  spend with your partner. there are many other things that are,  important to me, like a sense of humor (how else can you keep your,  perspective when things go wrong?), but i dont want to turn this,  into a list. i cant resist adding one more "trust". trust is,  harder to get then love, it requires much more time.,  ,  last winter, the furnace guy came to replace my furnace. he said i,  had a broken heat-exchanger. yes, its true, there has been,  precious little heat-exchanging going on in my house... how did he,  know?',
